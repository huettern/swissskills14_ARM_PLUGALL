swissskills14_ARM_PLUGALL
=========================

I participated to the Swiss Skills 2014. One task was to design specific software. I prepared myself with a custom microcontroller board and some libraries for faster workflow. 
I'm sharing my sources here for others to have some open libraries for the STM32f3 family. The code is not very good commented, so if you have questions or troubles, feel free to contact me.

This directory contains the template code and my self-written libraries to handle the PLUGALL bus communication.
